Problem: In this problem we will initialize a simple binary tree and invert initialize
First, lets discuss what a binary tree it. It is a tree data structure where each node has at most two children. A left child and a right child. Each node in a binary tree stores some data, a pointer to the left child and a pointer to the right child. This structure can be useful for searching, sorting, and organizing data, especially in scenarios like binary search trees (BSTs) or heaps. 

Basic Binary Tree Operations
Insertion - Adding nodes in the correct position based on some criteria
Traversal - Visiting all nodes in a certain order (e.g., in order, post-order, pre-order)
Deletion - Removing nodes while maintaining the binary tree's structure
Inversion - Swapping the left and right children of each node in the tree, essentially mirroring the tree

Ok, now that we have a basic understanding of a binary tree, lets start with writing the basic class structure of a binary tree and a binary tree node

Algorithmic Outline
Step 1: Node class - Each Node in a binary tree will: Store some data like an integer, char, or String
Have a reference to a left child
Have a reference to a right child

Step 2: BinaryTree class - The BinaryTree class will:
- Keep track of the root node of a tree
- Define any operations (insertion, Traversal, Deletion, Inversion) that we'd like to perform on the tree

Pseudocode Outline
// create a class for a node in the binary tree
Class Node:
  - Properties:
    - data: holds the value of the node
    - left: reference to the left child node (initially null)
    - right: reference to the right child node (initially null)
  
  - Constructor:
    - Set this.data to data
    - Set this.left to null
    - Set this.right to null
